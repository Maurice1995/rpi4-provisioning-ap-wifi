Captive portals work because devices make a DNS request to specific URLS, depending on which operating system, and they expect a success response. If they get a redirect instead, then they will show that new site as a captive portal.

A list of some of the URL's can be found here: How Automatic Detection of Captive Portal works.

If you followed that tutorial, then you can change your DNS server to redirect any request to a domain that isn't yours to the Raspberry Pi. The /etc/dnsmasq.conf file controls the DNS server. Add the following line to redirect all requests (change the IP address if you chose not to use 192.168.4.1)

address=/#/192.168.1.1

You will then need to set up your webserver to redirect those requests. I suggest choosing a URL, like http://mysite/, and telling your webserver (such as nginx) to show your site for that domain, and send a redirect for all other domains.

Differences between Client devices
All client devices use the above described strategy to find out if they are behind a captive portal, but the URL might vary depending on the specific model of smartphone, tablet, laptop and depending on the specific OS version.


In the following you can find a list of known domains contacted by each model in order to eventually trigger the captive portal.
